# DNS Server

# Process
  + user req to a domain
  + client side code get the informations (ip, reqested domain)
  + if server not on maintenance it will do further process
  + client information encode then sends to server
  + server decode
  + after decode server check block ip
  + server searches to the database for ip of requested domain
  + if ip not find it sends the not found response
  + if found ip it encodes data and send response to client
  + client decode that data
  + finally send to user with response
  + after certain time it will redirect to that ip/destination
  + if user blocked then user cannot request query
  + after certain time automatically user unblocked
  + then user can request again
